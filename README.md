# Anopheles mosquitos #
This projects main focus lies with the research into the anopheles mosquito, more specifically which viruses they could be carrying with them, since this mosquito is the vector for human malaria. This research into the mosquito and its possible viruses has been done with data collected from the NCBI website and in coordination with the NCBI databases in order to screen for endogenous viral elements (EVEs)

## Project description
One of the main goals of this project will focus on building/updating an already existing pipeline and make it so that it is able to screen anopheles data and map which viruses could be within the mosquito. This will also look for EVEs. This needs to be done so the differences between actual viruses and EVEs can be seen. 

Another goal for this project is that the mosquito data will be run through the pipeline and analysed, this will be done in order to see if any viruses pop up and which viruses they may be

The final product that will reside within this reposatory will be the pipeline that can analyse the anopheles mosquito data and gives a representation in the form of a dag file in order to show the user what happened.


## Installation
For the complete repository please use the following piece of code inside the terminal:
```git clone https://github.com/jlalisan/Anopheles```

In order to run the project, please install the packages that are required and check their version, it may occur that a different version of a package does not have the same functions.

Note that the databases for the NCBI are not in this repository since these are 300gb atleast. these can be remotely downloaded or used with NCBI.
